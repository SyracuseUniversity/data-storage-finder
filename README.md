# Data Storage Finder

## Overview

The Data Storage Finder is a tool developed by the Open Source Program Office at Syracuse University. It aims to help faculty and students find the most appropriate data storage option based on their specific needs using a simple survey method.

This tool is built on WordPress as the content management system, featuring a custom-written plugin that renders the user interface. This repository contains our custom plugin.

The inspiration for this tool was derived from the [CD-finder project](https://github.com/CU-CommunityApps/CD-finder) by Cornell University.
